# Shell Script: Filename with Spaces Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in shell scripting when dealing with filenames containing spaces. The `bug.sh` script illustrates the problem, and `bugSolution.sh` provides a corrected version.

The bug arises from an incorrect handling of variable expansion when a filename includes spaces.  The solution showcases the proper use of quoting to ensure reliable operation regardless of filename content.
